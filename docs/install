  Usage:
  
    kiwi install <name> [version]
    
  Description:
  
    Installs the latest version of <seed>, or attempts
    to install the given [version]. When <name> is a file
    it must be a flat list of seeds to install. When [version]
    is the filename of a locally built seed, then it will be installed,
    which is useful for testing a built before releasing it.
    
  Examples:
    
    Install the lastest version of a seed:
    
      $ kiwi install sass
    
    Installing a specific version:
    
      $ kiwi install sass ">~ major.minor.patch"
  
    The following operators are supported for matching versions:
    
      n/a  Equal to
      =    Equal to
      >    Greater than
      >=   Greater than or equal to
      >~   Greater than or equal to with compatibility (major must match)
    
    Installation from a flat file. For example the file "seeds" contains:
        
      - haml >= 0.0.1
      - sass >= 0.5.0
      - express >~ 0.0.1
    
    After which all three seeds can be installed by executing:
    
      $ kiwi install seeds
    
    Build and install the seed before releasing:
    
      $ kiwi build 0.4.0
      $ kiwi install sass 0.4.0.seed
